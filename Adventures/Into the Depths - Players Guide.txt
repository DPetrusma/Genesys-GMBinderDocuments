# <center>Welcome to {world}, the world of Magitech</center>

For almost a millennium, the Dwarf empire of Akar dominated the three continents. Their mastery over the fusion of magical power and technological innovation, what they called Magitech, led to the construction of great weapons of war and immense, beautiful cities. Yet, one day a few centuries ago, almost every inhabitant mysteriously disappeared.

Your character has come to join one of the treasure hunting guilds that have formed to seek out and retrieve the Akar artifacts. You may have been born raised in different corners of {continent 1}, but you will come to treat each other like family. Over time, you may decide to strike out on your own, apart from the guild, but you'll continue to work together. You may seek to uncover the mystery of the Great Vanishing, or you may simply seek after more powerful treasure.

So, build a character at a loose end or with a vague future goal, but who is willing to join the guild to start a new life. You should also be able to work well with a group of allies to help everyone accomplish their own goals.

# <center>Chapter 1: The Three Continents of {world}</center>

Since the Great Vanishing of the inhabitants of the Akar Empire, the great alliances that were formed to oppose them have splintered, and hundreds of surrounding kingdoms, duchies, and free cities seek out magitech treasure to bolster their own power. However, there are sill many guardians in the ruins. Many guilds have formed that specialise in Akar treasure hunting, but even as the weapons, trinkets, and automatons are slowly uncovered, no-one is closer to discovering the reason for the Great Vanishing.

The world of {world} contains three main continents: {continent 1}, {continent 2}, and {continent 3}, and our story starts in {continent 1}, on the borders of two small kingdoms. Many places will be inaccessible to your starting characters, but as your grow in experience and wealth, you will open up many options for exploration. Travelling through civilised lands is relatively safe, but there are still many dark places in the world.

Here are some themes you should know about this game in the world of {world}:

#### Magic and Technology have advanced together

The mineral magicite has always been found in {world} and the energy in it used to power magical abilities. However, it was dwarfs of Akar that unlocked the secrets of using magicite to power machinery, designing turbines, engines, and batteries. Many advances have been made over the following centuries, both in engineering and magic.
{black magic} is the aspect of magic related to understanding and manipulating the fundamental forces of the universe, and so it goes hand in hand with magitech. Yet, the same effort has gone into understanding {white magic}, the aspect of magic related to understanding and manipulating the energy generated by all living things.

\columnbreak

#### Humans are ascendant

Dwarves once dominated the land, but now their Akar Empire has fallen and they have all but disappeared, the Elves and Orcs have retreated to their enclaves - the Elves by choice, and the Orcs not so much. The Halflings still enjoy friendly relationships with the Humans they live alongside, but they are not as numerous as the Humans. As the many rulers in {world} jockey for power and unlock the secrets of the Akar, their borders expand while the other races are pushed aside.

#### Constant power struggles

During the zenith of the Akar empire, the other inhabitants of {world} feared an oppressive worldwide regime, and so many banded together. Even the Elves and Orcs lent their might, and the Mirran empire was formed by an alliance of more than two dozen kingdoms and duchies, who elected an emperor from among the most influential nobles.

Since the threat that brought them together has vanished, the old alliances have splintered. The Mirran empire still exists in name with an elected emperor, but he is powerless to stop the infighting as former allies seek the power left by the Akar. The world is full of dangerous borderlands and ruined cities as each ruler seeks a place in the new order.

#### You are an adventurer, not a hero

You were born in a rather nondescript home, led a decidedly non-heroic youth, and now have arrived to work as a treasure hunter for the guild. You will have the chance to perform mighty deeds and unlock dangerous secrets, but you will need to earn the privilege.

# <center>Chapter 2: Building Your Character<center>

At the start of the game, you will create a character who comes from some corner of {continent 1}. We mostly follow along with the steps outlines in the Genesys Core Rulebook, starting from page 32. You will decide some basic details about where you were born, how you were raised, and  what you want out of life. You will also decide why you've joined the treasure hunting guild. Remember, though, your background isn't as important as what you do in the game. You will also generate a character according to the game rules. And that means choosing a species, career, and purchasing starting equipment.

Choosing a species, class, and background details are about more than choosing game mechanics and abilities. It's about deciding the person you want your character to be. Elves are very different from humans. Scouts face challenges that are very different from wizards. And the world will treat you differently depending on who you are. Here are some basic details you can think about to get you started.

### Step 1: Determine Background

As per Genesys Core Rulebook page 34, keeping in mind your place in the world of {world}.

Remember that your character has ended up in the Treasure Hunting Guild of {city} as an adult, but where you were born is up to you, and how your spent your formative years will be determined by your species and career.

### Step 2: Select a Species

You must choose a Species. Most people in {continent 1} are human. Halflings are also common. Elves, Orcs, and Gensai are rare and unusual, and dwarves have all but disappeared with the Akar empire. If you choose not to play a human, you will have to figure out why your character is travelling in the human lands and dealing with human problems with human allies. And you will be treated as unusual by both the humans of the world and the other members of your own race. Perhaps you were an exile, suffered from a disaster, a member of a family of traders who lived near humans or was orphaned and adopted by humans. Or perhaps you left home for another reason. One that makes it very difficult to go back.

These are the species options available to you when creating a player character in {world}.

\columnbreak

## Humans

Humanity, short-lived and disadvantaged in many ways by nature, has nonetheless proven to be one of the most resilient, diverse, and ambitious races in {world}. What Humans, a curious lot, lack in natural gifts of the sort bestowed on other races they make up for in their willingness to learn, their determination, and their sheer adaptability.

Since Humans are the most populous species in {world}, starting as a Human gives you a lot of freedom in your place of origin - a local born and bred in Redgate, a traveller from the Vale of Dreams, or even a wanderer from one of the tribes on the fringes of civilisation.

## Elves

Since time before memory the Elves have resided in the great forests of {world}, rarely concerning themselves overly much with the doings of the shorter-lived races. However, when the Akar empire truly threatened to trespass the  boundaries of Elvandar, the Elves thought it prudent to take a hand in history. Since the Great Vanishing, they have retreated once more - the Eledhel to their home in the Green Heart, and the Glamredhel to their home in Darkwood.

Since Elves are rather reclusive and rarely form relationships with outsiders, starting as an Elf means you'll need a good reason for your character to have wandered beyond the boundaries of the forest to find a place in the wider world.

* **Wound Threshold:** 9 + Brawn
* **Strain Threshold:** 10 + Willpower
* **Starting Experience:** 90 XP
* **Special Abilities:** Each type of Elf has its own special abilities, listed in the corresponding entry.

#### Eledhel

The Elves that swear fealty to their ancient queen and live in the Green Heart call themselves the Eledhel, meaning "the people". They are aloof, graceful, and take a very long view of history thanks to their centuries-long lifespans. They are well-adapted to the precise nature of {black magic} and have crafted many beautiful artifacts that blur the line between magitech and nature.

* **Starting Skills:** Eledhel begin with one rank in Discipline. You still cannot train their Discipline above rank 2 during character creation.
* **Magicite Attunement:** Eledhel gain {black magic} as a career skill and begin with one rank in {black magic}. You still cannot train their {black magic} above rank 2 during character creation.

#### Glamredhel

Those Elves who prefer to following the path of "might makes right" separated themselves from the Elven queen long ago and came to live in Darkwood. Calling themselves Glamredhel, meaning "wild people", their current chieftain earned  his position by besting the previous one in deadly combat. They still disdain humans as much as their Eledhel cousins, but they tend to favour action over decades-long contemplation. Still, their relatively rough exterior belies the wisdom they possess.

* **Starting Skills:** Glamredhel begin with one rank in Survival. You still cannot train their Survival above rank 2 during character creation.
* **Nimble:** Glamredhel have a melee and ranged defense of 1.

## Orcs

It is easy for the other races to see the rigid brows, square jaws, and jutting tusks of the Orcs as signs of an overly simplistic, feral species, but few things could be further from the truth. They are as intelligent and complex as almost every other race - and smart enough to take advantage of anyone who dares underestimate them. Yet this common response has seen the Orcs keep to themselves for most of history, occasionally trading with the surrounding kingdoms and working with magicite in their own secretive way.

Since Orcs are often shunned by humans, you will need a good reason for your character to have left their tribe to join the guild. Perhaps they are an outcast, or one of the rare envoys told to learn what you can to report back to your family?

* **Wound Threshold:** 12 + Brawn
* **Strain Threshold:** 8 + Willpower
* **Starting Experience:** 100 XP
* **Special Abilities:** Each type of Orc has its own special abilities, listed in the corresponding entry.

#### Broken Plains Orc

The Orcs who hunt the Broken Plains are among the most powerful, ferocious beings in the world. They live the hard, lean life of nomads, following the great herds of elk, boars, and moose from one side of the Broken Plains to the other, forging a society that is equally influenced by their spirit-based magic, brutal war axes, and fearsome throwing spears.

* **Starting Skills:** Broken Plains Orcs begin with one rank in Coercion. You still cannot train their Coercion above rank 2 during character creation.
* **Battle Rage:** When making a melee attack, a Broken Plains Orc can choose to add <span class=" setback">b</span> to the check to add +2 to the damage dealt by one hit of that attack.

#### Stone-Dweller Orc

Though Orcs are generally as intellectually and socially capable as any other being in {world}, their immense size and incredible strength gives them some highly unusual advantages. While there is no inherent need for them to make a living using those assets, most find it too tempting a lure to resist. As such, Stone-Dweller Orcs, who have no compunctions about imitating human invention in their architecture, weaponry, and magic, often find themselves living lives of adventure as mercenaries, soldiers, constables, or crooks.

* **Starting Skills:** Stone-Dweller Orcs begin with one rank in Cool. You still cannot train their Cool above rank 2 during character creation.
* **Hot-Tempered:** While a Stone-Dweller Orc's strain exceeds half of their strain threshold, they add <span class="setback">bb</span> to all social skill checks and add 1 to the damage of one hit of each melee attack they make.
    
## Halflings

Halflings are a small, nimble, optimistic, and cheerful people who are quite at home living alongside humans. Halflings are known to enjoy the comforts of home, family, and kin. But they are also curious to a fault and strangely fearless. Hence, they are natural wanderers and rarely stay in one place for very long. They tend to travel in small family groups, living for a few years near one human community and moving to the next. They have a reputation for thievery that isn’t entirely unearned, and they are also known to be incredibly lucky.

\pagebreakNum

While Halflings are not as numerous as humans, their natural neighbourliness means they are much easer to find through the kingdoms of {world} than the Elves or Orcs. Still, as they tend to stay in family groups, you will need to think of why your particular character has left.

#### Burrow Halfling

Burrow Halfling are those who have mostly abandoned interactions with the other races. When they do leave their comfortable homes, it is typically for trade, alliance building, espionage, or, of course, the lure of adventure.

* **Starting Skills:** Burrow Halflings begin with one rank in Charm and one rank in Resilience. You still cannot train their Charm or Resilience above rank 2 during character creation.
* **Militia Training:** Burrow Halflings add <span class="boost">b</span> to all combat checks that target characters who have a larger silhouette than they do.

#### Wanderer Halfling

Some Halflings get a taste of the outside world during their year with the militia and set out to “scratch their itchy feet.” Whether on their own or in a small band, Wanderer Halflings are a common sight throughout all of Mennara.

* **Starting Skills:** Wanderer Halflings begin with one rank in Charm and one rank in Stealth. You still cannot train their Charm or Stealth above rank 2 during character creation.
* **Tricksy:** Once per encounter during their turn, a Wanderer Halfling may use this ability and spend a Story Point to produce a previously undocumented small item (encumbrance 1 or less) with a rarity no greater than 4 from a pocket, bag, pouch, nearby windowsill, passing cart, or other convenient location — even if there is no logical explanation for the item's presence. This item cannot be a weapon unless the weapon has the Limited Ammo 1 quality.

\columnbreak
    
## Gensai

Gensai are not a true race as they are understood. In fact, they were long thought to be beings of legend and myth. Or at least beings who died out in some long-forgotten age of the world. But since the fall of the Akar empire, a very small number of gensai have been born of human parents for unknown reasons. Most theorize they are the result of whatever strange event caused the Akar to vanish. Gensai births are unfortunately quite difficult, especially lightning gensai. To date no mother has survived more than a few days after giving birth to a gensai.

Though gensai as a species are rare, since they are found throughout human civilisation in {world}, almost everyone has encountered one, though they still arouse fear in some superstitious fringe settlements. With a Gensai character, you will need a reason to have joined the guild where you are likely the only one of your kind.

<!--
Elemental infused beings - Lightning, water, earth, wind. Maybe also fire, ice, holy, dark.
Or just fire, air, water, and earth.
They are smart but tend to be a little gullible and always believe the best of everyone. (Really? They aren't just scorned?)

Wind gensai tend to be tall and willowy with pale blue skin and whitish hair that always seems to be in motion. As changeable as the weather, their moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.

* **Starting Skills:** Wind Gensai begin with one rank in Coordination. You still cannot train their Coordination above rank 2 during character creation.
* **Elemental Affinity:** Wind Gensai have Wind affinity.
* **Unending Breath:** Wind Gensai can hold their breath indefinitely as long as they are not incapacitated.
* **Updraught:** Wind Gensai have a ranged defense of 1 again non-magical attacks.

\pagebreakNum

#### Lightning Gensai

Lightning gensai are red or purple skinned and their hair glows brilliant white or orange and crackles as if charged with static. They are a study in contrasts, passionate but not driven by their passions, cautious to act but moving swiftly when the time is right.

* **Starting Skills:** Lightning Gensai begin with one rank in Knowledge (Lore) or Deception. You still cannot train their Knowledge (Lore) or Deception above rank 2 during character creation.
* **Elemental Affinity:** Lightning Gensai have Lightning affinity.
* **Static Charge:** Lightning Gensai may choose to attack with the following weapons profile: (Brawl; Damage +1; Critical 3; Range [Engaged]; Disorient 1).
* **Ready to Pounce:** When a Lightning Gensai rolls initiative using Cool, they may immediately perform a single maneuver before the encounter begins.

#### Earth Gensai

Earth gensai tend to be stout and strong, with dark, coarse skin, black hair, and vibrant eyes the colour of gemstones. They tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider their options before taking action.

* **Starting Skills:** Earth Gensai begin with one rank in Athletics or Resilience. You still cannot train their Athletics or Resilience above rank 2 during character creation.
* **Elemental Affinity:** Earth Gensai have Earth affinity.
* **Tough Skin:** Earth Gensai increase their soak value by 1.
* **Unshakeable:** Once per session, an Earth Gensai may ignore the effects of an **Easy** (<span class="difficulty">d</span>) critical injury until the end of the encounter.

\columnbreak

#### Water Gensai

Water gensai are green-skinned, blue haired, and have shimmering aquamarine eyes. The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths — all of these things call to heart of a water gensai. They wander freely and take pride in their independence, though others often consider them selfish.

* **Starting Skills:** Water Gensai begin with one rank in Perception or Charm. You still cannot train their Perception or Charm above rank 2 during character creation.
* **Elemental Affinity:** Water Gensai have Water affinity.
* **Amphibious:** Water Gensai can breathe underwater without penalty and never suffers movement penalties for travelling through water.

### Step 3: Choose a Career

A player who is creating a character must select a career for that character. The following careers take the place of those described in the Genesys Core Rulebook. In addition to determining a character’s career skills and granting ranks in four of those skills, each career includes a list of starting gear. You may take this starting gear for your character instead of following the process for Starting Gear on page 51 of the Genesys Core Rulebook.

Your career determines how you spent your formative years, whether they were apprenticed to a harsh but fair mage, or fleecing nobles of their money in the city.

The careers available are {black mage}, Artificer, Barbarian, Envoy, {white mage}, Rogue, Scholar, Scout, and Warrior.

#### {black mage}

While most people understand that not all practitioners of {black magic} walk around in robes and silly hats, the very precise nature of this magic tends to attract a certain kind of person. Many of the scientists and engineers who brought {world} into the current modern age did so by harnessing the elemental forces of lightning, wind, and others through mechanical devices and magicite. The path of the {black mage} is as much about study and intellectual pursuits as it is about spellcasting.

The {black mage} counts the following skills as career skills: **Alchemy, {black magic}, Cool, Discipline, Coercion, Knowledge (Magitech), Knowledge (Lore),** and **Perception**. Before spending experience during character creation, a {black mage} may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

**Starting Gear:** Players with a {black mage} character may choose to start with the following gear instead of spending currency during Step 7 of character creation:
* A magic staff *or* magic wand
* A dagger *or* sling
* Heavy robes *or* 1 stamina elixir
* 1d100 silver coins

#### Artificer

With the advances in magitech during recent history, plus a constant demand from warmongering rulers across {world}, those gifted in building, maintaining, and tinkering with machines have come into a class of their own. Whether they are working with blacksmiths to forge magical blades, piloting a royal airship to ferry troops across the continent, or delving in Akar ruins for another source of magicite, Artificers are constantly for looking for ways to advance the understanding of magitech. 

The Artificer counts the following skills as career skills: **Alchemy, Knowledge (Magitech), Mechanics, Medicine, Negotiation, Operating, Ranged,** and **Streetwise**. Before spending experience during character creation, an Artificer may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

**Starting Gear:** Players with an Artificer character may choose to start with the following gear instead of spending currency during Step 7 of character creation:
* Bottled courage *or* smokebomb vial
* A dagger *or* sling
* Travelling gear consisting of a backpack, a bedroll, a rope, flint and steel, 3 torches, and a waterskin
* Magitech toolkit
* 1d100 silver coins

#### Barbarian

A Barbarian is a warrior and survivalist known for savagery in battle. They come from less civilized, more primitive
societies. A barbarian might be a warrior from one of the raiding sea reaver communities along the Windwrack Coast or from nomadic hunter tribes in the grasslands on the border of the Ghostwood. There are also small groups of tribeless, wild Orcs in the Skysunder Mountains who were almost always the result of a tragic disaster that destroyed most of a tribe.

The Barbarian counts the following skills as career skills: **Athletics, Brawl, Coercion, Melee (Heavy), Knowledge (Geography), Riding, Survival** and **Vigilance**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Barbarian may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

**Starting Gear:** Players with a Barbarian character may choose to start with the following gear instead of spending currency during Step 7 of character creation:
* A greataxe *or* a greatsword
* 2 healing herbs
* Winter clothing
* 1d100 silver coins

#### Envoy

Envoys are masters of negotiation, charm, and social intrigue. These charismatic heroes are often the voice of their group: they broker deals or convince others to offer aid, give up their secrets, or believe the hero's lies. Where blade and spell fail, Envoys find success, fighting as skillfully with words as their companions do with swords. With so many kings, dukes, and chieftans covering the three continents of {world}, Envoys are always in demand to broker peace, forge alliances, or even act as spies.

The Envoy counts the following skills as career skills: **Charm, Cool, Deception, Knowledge (Geography), Leadership, Melee (Light), Negotiation,** and **Vigilance**. Before spending experience during character creation, an Envoy may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

**Starting Gear:** Players with an Envoy character may choose to start with the following gear instead of spending currency during Step 7 of character creation:
* A dagger
* A sword *or* a musical instrument
* A fine cloak *or* travelling gear consisting of a backpack, a bedroll, a rope, flint and steel, 3 torches, and a waterskin
* Padded armor
* 200 + 1d100 silver coins
 
\pagebreakNum

#### {white mage}

On the the opposite side of the coin to {black magic}, {white magic} harnesses the spiritual power of the world more than the scientific laws of the universe. Though dedicated to healing and protection, {white mage}s are not necessarily pacifistic, nor is {white magic} purely defensive. {white magic} can be a powerful weapon against evil, and
blessings of strength and accuracy can greatly improve any warrior’s attacks – or transform a seemingly defenseless scholar into a surprisingly capable opponent. In addition, many {white magic} Mages who expect to see combat learn to employ bows or other distance weapons when their magic is not needed.

The {white mage} counts the following skills as career skills: **Charm, Cool, Discipline, Knowledge (Lore), Leadership, Medicine, Ranged,** and **{white magic}**. Before spending experience during character creation, a {white mage} may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

**Starting Gear:** Players with a {white mage} character may choose to start with the following gear instead of spending currency during Step 7 of character creation:
* A magic staff *or* magic wand
* A dagger *or* sling
* Heavy robes *or* 1 stamina elixir
* 1d100 silver coins

#### Rogue

A quick wit and a swift blade are often better than a swift blade alone. Like warriors and scouts, rogues are a broad group. Anyone who lives by guile, cunning, and expertise might be a rogue. Some are criminals – thieves and assassins – while others are spies, scouts, skirmishers, or diplomats. Every corner of the civilised world has its rogues, and no two rogues are precisely alike. Every rogue has a carefully honed skill set. Whether the party needs someone to navigate a trap-filled dungeon, evade a watchful foe, or find an ally in a shadowy city, often only a Rogue will know just the trick.

The Rogue counts the following skills as career skills: **Charm, Cool, Coordination, Deception, Ranged, Skulduggery, Stealth,** and **Streetwise**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Rogue may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

**Starting Gear:** Players with a Rogue character may choose to start with the following gear instead of spending currency during Step 7 of character creation:
* A dagger *or* a cestus
* A sword and dagger *or* a bow
* A fine cloak *or* thieves’ tools
* Travelling gear consisting of a backpack, a bedroll, a rope, flint and steel, 3 torches, and a waterskin
* 1d100 silver coins

\columnbreak

#### Scholar

Scholars are masters of the secrets of the natural world and the cultures within it. They are firm believers in the axiom "Knowledge is Power." The civilizations of the world, past and present, have collected millennia of lore, much of which lies buried beneath the noses of the various races. Wherever they go, Scholars see these hidden histories. Whether they are the old markings of the Locust Swarm upon the border stones of Godsteeth Isle, the kingly statues that rise up from the sands of the Dune Sea, or the scarred deepwyrm scales glittering on the trade ships of {continent 3}, a Scholar knows their meanings. There are as many kinds of Scholars as there are secrets, and most have their own specialisation.

The Scholar counts the following skills as career skills: **Alchemy, Knowledge (Magitech), Knowledge (Geography), Knowledge (Lore), Mechanics, Medicine, Perception,** and **Discipline**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Scholar may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

**Starting Gear:** Players with a Scholar character may choose to start with the following gear instead of spending currency during Step 7 of character creation:
* A dagger
* An alchemists' kit *or* a sword
* A lantern *or* healing herbs
* A fine cloak *or* travelling gear consisting of a backpack, a bedroll, a rope, flint and steel, 3 torches, and a waterskin
* 1d100 silver coins

#### Scout

Scouts are outlanders and wanderers, more at home among the forbidding wilds than in winding city streets. Because Scouts are skilled hunters and trackers, many governments employ them in the vanguard of their armies. Others simply live alone, off the land, protecting travelers who wander into their land. Others see themselves as protectors of the civilised people of the world. Regardless, they are experts in travelling the wilds of the world. Some non-Elven Scouts have even impressed the Eledhel enough that they are named elf-friend, though there are far less now than when the world was young and magicite devices had note come.

The Scout counts the following skills as career skills: **Athletics, Knowledge (Geography), Perception, Ranged, Riding, Stealth, Survival,** and **Vigilance**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Scout may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

**Starting Gear:** Players with a Scout character may choose to start with the following gear instead of spending currency during Step 7 of character creation:
* A bow *or* a light spear and leather armor
* A dagger *or* 2 healing elixirs
* Leather armor
* Herbs of healing and climbing gear *or* winter clothing
* Travelling gear consisting of a backpack, a bedroll, a rope, flint and steel, 3 torches, and a waterskin
* 1d100 silver coins

#### Warrior

Warriors dedicate themselves to the mastery of blade, axe, and other weapons of war. Whether they rely upon raw strength to crush their enemies, hefty armour to soak hits before dishing them out, or speed and skill to avoid attacks — and deliver killing ripostes — all Warriors excel in the art of combat. They come from every walk of life, from soldiers and generals to street thugs, raiders, mercenaries, and gladiators. And no two warriors are precisely alike. Each has their own combat style. The only thing that unites fighters as a group is their skill at arms. All warriors are masters of weapon and armour. And, except for enchanted relics and magical items, warriors do not use magic.

The Warrior counts the following skills as career skills: **Brawl, Coercion, Leadership, Melee (Heavy), Melee (Light), Resilience, Riding,** and **Vigilance**. Before spending experience during character creation, a warrior may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

**Starting Gear:** Players with a Warrior character may choose to start with the following gear instead of spending currency during Step 7 of character creation:
* A sword and a shield *or* an axe and shield *or* a halberd
* Leather armour
* 2 healing elixirs
* Travelling gear consisting of a backpack, a bedroll, a rope, flint and steel, 3 torches, and a waterskin
* 1d100 silver coins

### Step 4: Invest Experience Points

As per Genesys Core Rulebook page 44. See page 10 of this player's guide for the full list of available skills.

### Step 5: Derived Attributes

As per Genesys Core Rulebook page 45

### Step 6: Character Motivation

As per Genesys Core Rulebook page 46, keeping in mind your place in the world of {world}.

### Step 7: Choose Gear, Appearance, and Personality

As per Genesys Core Rulebook page 51. Remember that you may **either** choose the starting gear given by your class in Step 3 **or** spend 500 silver on your starting gear, with an extra d100 silver as "pocket money".

## Knowledge Skills

The new skills in this section take the place of the single Knowledge skill presented in the Genesys Core Rulebook.

### Geography (Intellect)

Geography is a character's understanding of the lay of the land and its different cultures, including those cultures' customs and laws. Geography includes the comprehension of maps and cartography, regional variations in etiquette, and matters of navigation. A character with ranks in Knowledge (Geography) can chart a course over land or sea, describe the locations of major cities and landmarks from memory, avoid unknowingly violating local laws, and warn their allies of the sensitive conversation topics to avoid in a particular town.

#### Your character should use this skill if...

* Your character wants to chart a course through dangerous wilderness to a nearby village.
* Your character wants to indicate the approximate location of a landmark or settlement from memory.
* Your character needs to select appropriate garb so as not to stand out among the locals.

#### Your character should not use this skill if...

* Your character needs to set a camp or deal with the other practical matters of traversing the wilderness. That would use Survival.
* Your character tries to recall the history of a ruin. They would use Knowledge (Lore) for that.

### Lore (Intellect)

Lore represents a character's knowledge of magic, legends, religion, and similar matters. It includes both folktales and recent history, as well as matters arcane and obscure that only sages could know. Lore encompasses specialised, scholarly, and esoteric knowledge of the type that most common folk would consider impractical. A character with ranks in Knowledge (Lore) can recall relevant details from ancient legends, recognize rare religious icons, and even identify whether an event is magical or mundane in cause.

#### Your character should use this skill if...

* Your character tries to identify the origins of an ancient sword recovered from a ruin.
* Your character wants to determine the source of a wizard’s magic after witnessing it in action.
* Your character attempts to recall a terrible legend of the Sun War.

#### Your character should not use this skill if...

* Your character tries to cast a spell. This would require the use of a magic skill.
* Your character attempts to read a map. That would use Knowledge (Geography).

\columnbreak

### Magitech (Intellect)

Science and magic blur together in the world of {world}, and Magitech is your character's understanding of the theories and laws governing these relationships, as well as matters of mathematics, architecture, and chemistry. A character with ranks in Knowledge (Magitech) can understand how various magitech devices are powered (without necessarily knowing how to build one), how raw magicite could be repurposed, and use physics to calculate the rough trajectory of a projectile.

#### Your character should use this skill if...

* Your character wants to find the power source of an Akar magitech artifact
* Your character wants to instruct a {black mage} on fusing magicite with a machine or weapon.
* Your character tries to do something academic regarding the physical world, such as perform a complicated mathematical calculation, write a monograph on the plants of Darkwood, or conduct a scientific experiment.

#### Your character should not use this skill if...

* Your character needs to know information that is fairly simple or trivial. Calculating 2+2=4 should not require a check, for example.
* Your character wants to know how to design, build, or repair a mechanical device. This is covered by Mechanics.
* The answer your character is looking for can be found in an accessible, easily referenced source, such as a public city ledger. Whether or not your character can apply this information, however, may be determined by a Knowledge check.

## Magic Skills

These magic skills replace the ones found in the Genesys Core Rulebook on page 70.

### {black magic} (Intellect)

{black magic} is the more complex expression of magic. With it, one learns to harness the fundamental forces of the universe, learning complex formulae applying them to reshape matter and energy. It is the form of magic that led to the development of magitech when it was discovered how to store energy in magicite after it has been expended. Due to this, many scholars and scientists are practitioners of {black magic}.

Spells to summons walls of force, bolts of fire, and barriers of lightning are all part of {black magic} as a user manipulates their surrounding energy, but it is ill-suited to spells of healing and other biological manipulation.

#### Your character should use this skill if...

* Your character wants to fire a bolt of elemental magic at an enemy.
* Your character attempts to fuse a magicite crystal with a machine or weapon.
* Your character tries to create a wall of force to stop incoming attack.

\pagebreakNum

#### Your character should not use this skill if...

* Your character wants to magically heal someone.
* Your character attempts to affect an ally or enemies biology.

### {white magic} (Willpower)

Where {black magic} draws on the forces that govern the universe, {white magic} draws on the natural energy of all life on {world}. As such, {white mage}s largely eschews directly damaging foes except in extremis, but they are more than capable of empowering their allies with great strength or draining the vitality of those who underestimate them. Even though it does not require rigorous study to master, any skilled {white magic} mage knows that the discipline to properly channel their energy can take years to attain.

Re-knitting broken bones, blinding enemies, and imbuing allies with great speed and toughness are all the domain of {white magic} as a user manipulates the energy of life around them.

\columnbreak

#### Your character should use this skill if...

* Your character lays hands on someone to heal their wounds or disease.
* Your character  calls on their magic to bolster an ally.
* Your character tries to guide ghostly spirits to oblivion.

#### Your character should not use this skill if...

* Your character attempts to manipulate someone to persuade them. This could be augmented by {white magic}, but would require the Charm skill.
* Your character tries to unweave an enemy's spell.

## Magic in {world}
A character may purchase ranks in a magic skill only if it is a career skill.

As listed in the Genesys Core Rulebook, some of the spell effects characters can apply to magic actions depend on a character's ranks in Knowledge. Because {world} introduces multiple Knowledge skills, this rule needs additional clarification. In the {world}, any spell effect that refers to the spellcaster’s ranks in Knowledge uses Knowledge (Lore). A character cannot use other Knowledge skills as the basis for these effects, unless they have a talent or special rule that allows it.

##### Magic Skills and Actions
| | {black magic} | {white magic} |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Attack | Yes | Yes |
| Augment | No | Yes |
| Barrier | Yes | No |
| Conjure | Yes | No |
| Curse | No | Yes |
| Dispel | Yes | No |
| Heal | No | Yes |
| Predict | No | Yes |
| Mask | Yes | No |
| Utility | Yes | Yes |

## Talents
See Realms of Terrinoth pages 85-87 for a list of talents appropriate for this setting, excluding any that refer to the following skills: Knowledge (Forbidden), Knowledge (Adventuring), Divine, Arcana, Verse, Primal.

Other talents in the Genesys Core Rulebook pages 72-81 may be chosen after discussion with the GM, who may add further available talents in the future.

## Elements
When an attack with an elemental affinity is made against a target that also has an affinity, look up the attack’s affinity on the table. If the target's elemental affinity is listed in the Vulnerability column, add <span class="boost">b</span> to the attack roll. If it’s listed in the Resistance column, add <span class="setback">b</span> to the attack roll.

If a creature or attack has more than one affinity, repeat this process for each element involved. A creature cannot gain affinity for an element more than once; they either have an affinity or they do not. Note that a creature that has an affinity does not automatically add that affinity to attacks they make. An attack or creature that does not have an affinity is referred to as "non-elemental".

\columnbreak

##### Element Interactions
| Affinity | Vulnerability | Resistance |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Lightning | Earth | Lightning, Water |
| Earth | Wind | Earth, Lightning |
| Wind | Water | Wind, Earth |
| Water | Lightning | Water, Wind |

# GM Rules (WIP)

## Disabled Status

An effect that would cause your wounds to exceed your wound threshold instead brings your wound total to your wound threshold. While your wounds are equal to your wound threshold, you are **Disabled**. While a character is disabled, they can only perform either one action or one maneuver per turn, and if they perform an action, they suffer one wound at the end of that turn. Thus, they will be incapacitated at the end of that turn unless their action involves healing.

## Skill Challenges

Basically, to represent long tasks, the party needs to roll 10/15/20/25/30 success symbols before 3/5 failed checks.

## Extra Equipment

#### Magitech toolkit

Like alchemists and apothecaries, artificers often travel with specialised kits. These kits commonly contain various hand tools, levels, pliers, spare wiring, adhesive, and various magicite chips necessary for repairing machines and other items.

A magitech toolkit allows your character to perform most Mechanics checks to repair devices (or dismantle them).
